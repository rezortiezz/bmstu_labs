# bmstu_labs
this is the repository where i will store my university's self-made nd self-pased labs. i dont do it because i have to, i do it with educational purposes.
sometimes there will be labs that i have to do beacause of my university's work plan and i will mark it with _mst tag in the end of file's name.

05.09.22 added lab02 without documentation, works properly
clock converter: converts hh mm format to alphabetic format.

12.09.22 added lab03 no docs. im not sure if it works properly but i hope so. default for cycles practise
